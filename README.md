# AI Cover Letter Generator

A Streamlit web app that generates personalized cover letters using Google Gemini (gemini-2.5-flash). The app extracts text from uploaded resumes (PDF/DOCX), analyzes job descriptions, generates tailored cover letters with a selectable tone, and optionally translates the output into multiple languages.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS / Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Add your Gemini API key in a `.env` file (project root):

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

4. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open the URL shown by Streamlit in your browser.

## Environment & Security

* Store all sensitive keys (API tokens) in `.env` and **do not commit** `.env` to version control.
* Add `.env` to `.gitignore`:

```
.env
```

## How It Works (High Level)

1. User opens the app and chooses either **Generate Cover Letter** or **Analyze Job Description** tab.
2. For generation: user provides the job description, uploads a resume, selects tone and language, then clicks **Generate**.
3. The app extracts text from the resume (PyMuPDF preferred; fallback to PyPDF2 or docx2txt). The text + job description + tone are formed into a prompt.
4. The prompt is sent to Gemini 2.5 Flash (`google-generativeai`) which returns an English cover letter.
5. If requested, the letter is translated using `deep-translator` to the target language.
6. The final text is displayed and can be improved or downloaded as a DOCX via `python-docx`.

## Example Prompts

**Generation prompt** (sent to Gemini):

```
You are an expert career coach and professional writer.
Write a personalized {tone} cover letter based on the information below.

Job Description:
{job_description}

Candidate Resume:
{resume_text}

Instructions:
- Make the letter engaging and relevant to the job.
- Highlight the most suitable skills and experiences.
- Keep it professional and concise.
- Include a polite closing statement.
```

**Analysis prompt** (JD Analyzer):

```
Analyze the following job description and extract:
- Key technical and soft skills
- Job role focus areas
- Important keywords and themes
- Ideal tone or communication style

Job Description:
{jd_text}
```

## Tips & Best Practices

* Prefer **PyMuPDF (fitz)** for robust PDF extraction, especially for complex layouts.
* Keep prompts concise and include explicit instructions about tone and formatting.
* Translate only after finalizing the English version for best accuracy.
* Respect user privacy: do not persist resumes or generated letters unless users explicitly opt in.

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

* Add user accounts and a history of generated letters (with user consent).
* Add DOCX templates and multi-template export (PDF + DOCX).
* Add more advanced prompt templates or few-shot examples to improve output quality.
* Add caching to reduce repeated API calls for the same inputs.

If you want, I can also generate a `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`, or a ready-to-copy DOCX export helper function for this repo.
